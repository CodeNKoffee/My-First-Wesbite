                <li><i>“Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”
                    ― Steve Job</i></li><br>
                <li><i>“When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.”
                    ― Steve Jobs</i></li><br>
                <li><i>“The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.” 
                    — Steve Jobs
